# Currency-Convertor
<p>
The Currency Converter is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to convert between different currencies in real-time. The interface includes input fields for the amount and dropdowns for selecting the base and target currencies.<br><br>

JavaScript is used to handle conversions, while the Fetch API retrieves live exchange rates from a third-party API. The conversion is triggered automatically when users enter an amount or change currencies, ensuring real-time updates with accurate rates.<br><br>

CSS is used to create a responsive, user-friendly design, ensuring the app looks and works well on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.<br><br>

Features:<br>
Live exchange rates via Fetch API.<br>
Automatic conversions based on user input.<br>
Responsive design for all devices.<br>
This project showcases the practical application of APIs in modern web development.</p>
